This is a simple article that contains various helpful documentation, I already used to build a Spring boot REST API.
It helps to have one place with everything on a subject. I will try to be as exhaustive as possible.
If you think of anything, feel free to leave a comment and I will add it. As long as it is relevant to the subject and you think can help anyone.

So everyone, have a good reading!

Thanks for all the authors that wrote those very useful article, you help a lot of
developer and new joiners everyday and we are grateful for all the work you do.
