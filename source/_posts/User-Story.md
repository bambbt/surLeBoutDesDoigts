# User story


User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them.
The goal is to understand the user situations. In those conversation, one has to be empathize with the other. Take the place of the user in order to behave like him and understand his/her ideas, issues, etc...


## Definition

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the person who desires the new feature.

Those short descriptions are usually written following a simple template:

"As a **_type of user_**, I want **_some goal_** so that **_some reason_**.

The advantages of such template are :
* Improvement of focus from writing features to discussing them
* Facilitate planning using Jira, sticky notes or else.


## One example

Let's try this with one example to see the advantages of user stories.

"As a **_restaurant manager_**, I can **_book a table_**.

Now if you consider this situation as is, one could agree that this is rather a simple situation. So I could say, the **manager** just want to be able to book a table, so let's just create a system for him to be able to do just that.

But If you simulate this with anyone, you should naturally be pushed to ask more questions such as:
* How many tables do you have ?
* How many people your tables can take ?
* Who booked the table ?
* At what time the table is booked, it is not gonna be the whole day, I guess ?

And those questions can arise new questions, etc, etc...
That is the dialogue, you want to happen. This dialogue will give you the details that are important for the customer and those who will shape the way you will work to achieve the mission the stakeholder gave.
